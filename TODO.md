# To Do list

## Priority
- [ ] Set up Firebase auth
- [ ] Set up Firestore database
- [ ] Set up SendBird chat

## Backlog
- [ ] Update service worker to cache images and fonts from a list of authorized domains (currently only caches from same domain). [docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app/)
- [ ] Fill out the app manifest with favicon, icon, etc
- [ ] Set up a way to test the service worker locally (because by default it won't work in development env)
- [ ] Add partytown to the project so that app loads faster and load other scripts after [docs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIR1NGwy-s)
- [ ] Set up SendBird auth tokens after setup of Firebase auth. Only allow secure chat. [docs](https://sendbird.com/docs/chat/v4/javascript/application/authenticating-a-user/authentication#2-connect-to-the-sendbird-server-with-a-user-id-and-a-token)
